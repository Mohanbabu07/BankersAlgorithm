## Introduction

The Banker's Algorithm is an essential part of modern operating systems, ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently while avoiding potential deadlocks. This simulation allows users to input Allocation and Maximum matrices, calculates the Need matrix, and determines if a safe sequence exists for the given resource allocation scenario.

## Features

- Interactive matrix inputs for Allocation and Maximum resources.
- Automatic calculation of the Need matrix.
- Determination and display of the safe sequence, if one exists.
- Visualization of the Banker's Algorithm in action.
- Error handling for invalid input scenarios.
